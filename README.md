# Racket-Lab-1
Contains functions within Racket. 

Contains functions to find the y-intercept and x-intercept of a function given the m and b of the function. There is another function to find the area of a triangle formed between the x and y intercepts of a line. Then, there are two functions that are mod circles, one is an addition mod circle and another is a subtraction mod circle. The last function follows a clock with it's mod circle. It allows time to be added and gives the time that it would be after that amount of minutes is added.
